## Frequently Asked Questions
### Why is this project only about web applications and not about any kind of software?
Web applications can easily collect data from users without their permission or without adequately informing them how their data is used. Cookies, and other trackers, enable the monitoring of userâ€™s behaviour, and this information may be used for a variety of commercial purposes, including targeted advertising, profiling, and the sale of aggregated data. Thus, the topic is very important, especially for web applications.
### Are the Top 10 Privacy Risks applicable for mobile apps as well?
Privacy risks for mobile apps are very similar. The rating might be slightly different and there might be some additional risks related to the loss of devices and the use of location data, but in general the Top 10 Privacy Risks are applicable for mobile apps as well.
### What is the difference between this project and the OWASP Top 10?
There are two main differences. First, the OWASP Top 10 describes technical security risks that are not primarily affecting privacy. Second, the OWASP Top 10 do not address organisational issues like privacy notices, profiling, or the sharing of data with third parties.
### Why should companies and other organisations be concerned about privacy risks?
Privacy risks may have serious consequences for an organisation, such as:
* perceived harm to privacy;
* a failure to meet public expectations on both the use and protection of personal information;
* retrospective imposition of regulatory conditions;
* low adoption rates or poor participation in the scheme from both the public and partner organisations;
* the costs of redesigning the system or retro-fitting solutions;
* failure of a project or completed system;
* withdrawal of support from key supporting organisations due to perceived privacy harms; and/ or
* failure to comply with the law, leading to enforcement action from the regulator or compensation claims from individuals.
