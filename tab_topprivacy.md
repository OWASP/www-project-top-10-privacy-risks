<td>Vulnerability is a key problem in any system that guards or operates on
sensitive user data. Failure to suitably design and implement an
application, detect a problem or promptly apply a fix (patch) is likely
to result in a privacy breach. This risk also encompasses the OWASP Top
10 List of web application vulnerabilities and the risks resulting from
them.</td>
